This repository contains a scilab script to make a model of genes/proteins regulated by the circadian clock in neurospora mice, and a pdf report where the result are analyzed.
The script is capable of :
1) To plot a graph of the different variable of the model in function of the time.
2) To plot a graph that give visually the equilibrium point of the model.
3) To calculate the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix to study the stability of this equilibrium
4) To calculate the period of the expression
5) To calculate the influence of each parameters on the model
6) To compare the performance of the model with the original biological data
7) To plot on a graph the value of the period in function of a parameter
